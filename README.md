This project is a statistical portal for Finnish municipalities

This project uses Leaflet to utilize GJSON for creating a map. The project uses multiple different data elements from Tilastokeskus (https://statfin.stat.fi/PxWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/) which are displayed both in a map and in charts.

Charts use Frappe.io framework.

The project is done in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
